# Todo App

One day, I realized that I never created a todo app in a low-level programming langauge like c or c++. I used to think all one needs is a vector to create a todolist. While programming in `RustðŸ¦€`, I soon realized a need for a State Management System, and also there is no `global` keyword in this crab language. So, I wanted to test myself by creating my own state management system. Now, after creating this dumpster fire, I realized I was better off using a database instead. God rest the poor souls who go went through a roundtrip to hell by having an exposure to my code. All the mind-crippling logic that somehow works (?) can melt anyone's brain. Please wander here at your own risk.
