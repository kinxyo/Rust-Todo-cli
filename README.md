# Rust-based CLI Todo App

~~A simple todo app written in Rust because I just wanted to write my own state management system from scratch.~~

Initial motivation was to create a simple todo list but then out of nowhere, I was inspired to add more features to make it a full fledged CLI app.

## Â¿ Why `RustðŸ¦€` ?

Because I love this crab language.

## System Design

### Structs & their functions

In this codebase, the two primary structs are utilized: `State` and `User`.

- `State` is essentially a tuple struct that holds a HashMap containing the `User` object. Alternatively, `State` can also be referred to as the "_server_" since it fulfills all the backend functions. This designation is apt because an instance of `State` encompasses and manages all the data.
In the HashMap, the 'key' is the 'username' (which is a `String`) and the value is the `User` object. Now, I know that `String`(s) are slower to hash than any number-type however, this is a smaller application so I don't think it would have be neccessary. Creating a `user_id` would only complicate this simple project.

- On the other hand, `User` serves as a mere abstraction layer. The `main` function exclusively engages with the `User` struct, treating it as an interface (**API**) to access all the backend functions.

The following are the API functions:

- `User::welcome()` creates an instance `State` and loads previous data into it (if present), otherwise returns a fresh instance.

- `User::handle()` returns 'username' of the logged-in user. This username, as state before, is the key of the HashMap so via it I can access the `User` object of the logged-in user without passing a mutable reference to the `User` object everywhere (like I was doing before).

- `User::task()` Takes input for todo-list and call upon other backend functions to accordingly manipulate the state.

- `User::view()` returns a vector of all the tasks of the logged-in user.

(with more to come)

### Error Handling & Bug Reporting

#### Bugs & Panics

I have let some errors panic because I feel that these errors that are never going to happen under normal circumstances, and even if they do, there really is no way to keep the program running after that. In such extremely rare cases, I would really prefer if the program crashes.
For example, in _todo.rs_ :-

```rust
let file = std::fs::OpenOptions::new().create(true).append(true).read(true).open("db.json").expect("Failed to access the `state`");
```

I want the program to crash here because if `db.json` is not created (when not present) then there will be no 'State Preservation', the program will be of no use. However, this is very unlikely to happen & probably only because of permission issues. There is nothing I can do to get permission from the app itself, this solely lies on user's end.

But, to not let such crashes go in vain, I have implemented a **bug reporting system** that logs the error in a file. At first, I wanted to automatically upload this file after every write but then I felt that would be sorta intrusive. Therefore, since this file is created in the root directory, the user then has a choice to send this file to the developer (me) to help them with the debug the issue.

This project is not so serious that this will be actually needed but I wanted to implement this feature to learn how to do it.

#### Error Handling

In my code, there are a lot of methods that return a `Result`. It's rather hectic to individually handle all of them (actually, I did just that and ended up making code very unreadable).
Hence, I used something that I call **_Wrapping Function_**.

Basically, I apply `?` operator on returning methods, and then I wrap them in a function that returns `Result` and then I apply `match` case on that function. This way, I can keep the code clean and also handle the errors.

## Crates Used

1. Serde (for preserving `State` in JSON format)
2. Dialoguer (for making CLI interactive)

## Features left to implement (TODO)

- [x] Refactor Code
- [x] Error log
- [x] Persistance of state
- [x] Panic if unable to create or load `(db + error).json`.
- [x] Add support for selecting items using arrow key (Interactive Terminal).
- [x] Add `logout` functionality.
- [x] Show Users on Welcome Page
- [ ] Handle case where `password` is wrong.
- [ ] Add support of `remeber user`.
- [ ] Limit `username` to 10 characters.
- [ ] Limit user accounts to 5 people.
- [ ] Add datetime to error log.
- [ ] Add `help` command.
- [ ] Add a `delete db.json` function when 'data is corrupted' error occurs.
- [ ] Add full-fledged Authentication System.
- [ ] Update to proper Argument Parser.
- [ ] Updating Error log to Server (at exit command perhaps).
- [ ] `Complete Task` Functionality
- [ ] `Remove User` Functionality
- [ ] `Delete a Task` Functionality
