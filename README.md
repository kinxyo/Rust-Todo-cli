# Rust Todo-cli

A feature-full Rust-based Todo app that installs and runs on cli because I just want to write my own state management system from scratch.


## TODO

- [ ] Refactor Code
- [ ] Remove User
- [ ] Delete a Task
- [ ] Error Handling for all cases
- [ ] Persistance of state, meaning saving it to a file or a database.
